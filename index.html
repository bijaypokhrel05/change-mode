        <h1>Introduction of Javascript</h1>
        <hr>
        <p id ='first'>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language that is widely used for creating interactive and dynamic content on the web. Originally developed by Netscape in 1995, it has grown into one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p id = 'second'>JavaScript is primarily used on the client side (in web browsers) to enhance user interfaces and improve user experiences. It enables features such as interactive forms, animations, real-time updates, and asynchronous communication with servers (via AJAX or Fetch API). However, with the introduction of Node.js, JavaScript can now also run on the server side, enabling full-stack development using a single language.</p>
