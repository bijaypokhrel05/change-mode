## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)


## 🧠 How It Works

- The `body` element is given a class of either `light-mode` or `dark-mode`
- The toggle button calls JavaScript to switch these classes
- CSS handles the different background and text colors for each mode
- Optional: Use `localStorage` to remember the selected mode between sessions
